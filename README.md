# Uganda Electoral Mapping and Analytics Dashboard

## Project Overview

The Uganda Electoral Mapping and Analytics Dashboard is a secure, interactive web application built with Vue.js 3, designed to visualize election results across Uganda’s administrative divisions (regions, districts, sub-counties, parishes). It highlights top-performing candidates or parties while adhering to military-grade security standards. The system is tailored for stakeholders like the Uganda Electoral Commission (EC), election observers, and analysts. It supports offline access for remote areas and ensures WCAG 2.1 accessibility compliance.

Key Features:
- Interactive geospatial mapping using Leaflet.js.
- Real-time vote analytics and exports.
- Secure authentication and RBAC.
- Offline functionality via Service Workers.

## Detailed Feature Breakdown

### 1. Secure Authentication and Role Management
- Restrict access based on roles (EC Admin, Regional Officer, Public Viewer).
- Login with email/password and simulated 2FA.
- Role-based access control (RBAC) for data visibility.
- Session management with auto-logout for inactivity.
- Technology: Vue Router, Pinia, CryptoJS.

### 2. Interactive Geospatial Mapping
- Choropleth maps showing vote distribution by region, district, or parish.
- Zoomable interface with tooltips for polling station details.
- Color gradients with dynamic legends.
- Filters for election type, year, and candidate/party.
- Technology: Leaflet.js, vue3-leaflet, Turf.js.

### 3. Vote Analytics Dashboard
- Overview panel with national vote totals and regional comparisons.
- Searchable, filterable data tables for polling station results.
- Export options for CSV/JSON summaries.
- Technology: Vue Good Table, Axios, Pinia.

### 4. Best Performers Visualization
- Bar charts for top candidates/parties.
- Pie charts for vote distribution in selected areas.
- Heatmap overlays for strongholds.
- PDF report generation.
- Technology: Chart.js, leaflet.heat, jsPDF.

### 5. Security and Usability Enhancements
- Client-side encryption and audit logging.
- Offline functionality with Service Workers.
- WCAG 2.1 compliance (accessibility).
- Technology: LocalForage, CryptoJS, Vuelidate.

## Technical Architecture

- **Framework**: Vue.js 3 (Composition API).
- **State Management**: Pinia.
- **Mapping**: vue3-leaflet, Leaflet.js, Turf.js.
- **Visualization**: vue-chartjs, Chart.js.
- **Security**: CryptoJS, Vuelidate.
- **Offline Support**: LocalForage, Service Workers.
- **UI Styling**: Tailwind CSS/Vuetify.

## Development Plan (8 Weeks)

### Weeks 1-2: Setup and Foundation
- Initialize Vite project with Vue 3 and Tailwind CSS.
- Set up authentication module (login form, role-based guards).
- Acquire GeoJSON and vote data; create mock API with JSON Server.
- Define folder structure.

### Weeks 3-4: Core Mapping and Analytics
- Implement map component with vue3-leaflet.
- Build analytics dashboard with Vue Good Table.
- Add region, election type, and candidate filters.

### Weeks 5-6: Advanced Features
- Extend map for district/parish-level views.
- Implement charts for top performers.
- Add PDF export and offline caching.

### Weeks 7-8: Security, Testing, and Deployment
- Add encryption and audit logging.
- Ensure WCAG compliance and test responsiveness.
- Write unit and E2E tests.
- Deploy as a Progressive Web App (PWA).

## Challenges and Mitigations

- **Large Geospatial Data**: Use lazy-loading and simplified geometries.
- **Performance**: Optimize with Web Workers and Vue’s v-memo.
- **Data Accuracy**: Supplement historical data with mock data.
- **Security**: Encrypt sensitive data and validate server-side.

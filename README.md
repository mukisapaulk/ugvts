Uganda Electoral Mapping and Analytics Dashboard
Project Overview
The Uganda Electoral Mapping and Analytics Dashboard is a secure, interactive web application built with Vue.js 3, designed to visualize election results across Uganda’s administrative divisions (regions, districts, sub-counties, parishes) while highlighting top-performing candidates or parties. It incorporates military-grade security principles, such as role-based access control (RBAC), client-side encryption, and audit logging, ensuring data integrity and restricted access. The system targets stakeholders like the Uganda Electoral Commission (EC), election observers, and analysts, with features supporting offline access for remote areas (e.g., Karamoja) and WCAG 2.1 accessibility compliance.

Objective: Develop a robust Vue.js frontend to display vote data geospatially (using Leaflet.js) and analytically (using Chart.js), with secure access controls and offline capabilities.
Context: Uganda has four regions (Central, Eastern, Northern, Western), 135 districts, ~2,184 sub-counties, and ~10,000 parishes, with ~34,684 polling stations as of 2021. The system uses mock or historical vote data (e.g., 2016/2021 elections) and simulates live updates.
Military-Grade Aspects: Adheres to standards like MIL-STD-498 and NIST SP 800-53, focusing on confidentiality, availability, and auditability.

Detailed Feature Breakdown
The dashboard comprises five core modules, leveraging advanced Vue.js features and third-party libraries to enhance skills while addressing Uganda’s electoral needs.
1. Secure Authentication and Role Management

Purpose: Restrict access to sensitive vote data based on user roles (e.g., EC Admin, Regional Officer, Public Viewer).
Features:
Login form with email/password and simulated two-factor authentication (2FA) using a mock OTP.
Role-based access control (RBAC): Admins view/edit all data; Officers see region-specific data; Public sees anonymized summaries.
Route guards to protect sensitive views (e.g., parish-level raw votes).
Session management with auto-logout after inactivity.


Implementation:
Use Vue Router for guarded routes (e.g., /admin, /region/:id).
Store user roles and JWT-like tokens in Pinia, with localStorage for persistence (encrypted via CryptoJS).
Validate inputs with Vuelidate to prevent injection attacks.
Mock authentication API with JSON Server or MirageJS.



2. Interactive Geospatial Mapping

Purpose: Visualize vote distributions across Uganda’s administrative hierarchy on an interactive map.
Features:
Choropleth map showing vote totals or percentages by region, district, sub-county, or parish.
Zoomable interface with tooltips displaying vote counts, candidate breakdowns, and turnout percentages per polling station.
Filters for election type (presidential/parliamentary), year, or candidate/party.
Color gradients (e.g., green for high votes, red for low) with a dynamic legend.
Clickable regions to drill down into sub-levels (e.g., Central Region → Wakiso District → Kira Parish).


Implementation:
Use Leaflet.js with vue3-leaflet for map rendering; load GeoJSON files for boundaries (from HDX or UBOS).
Process geospatial data with Turf.js for aggregating vote totals (e.g., sum votes across parishes in a district).
Bind reactive vote data from Pinia to map layers for dynamic updates.
Optimize performance with lazy loading of parish-level data (only load on zoom).



3. Vote Analytics Dashboard

Purpose: Provide tabular and graphical summaries of election results for quick insights.
Features:
Overview panel with national vote totals, turnout rates, and regional comparisons.
Searchable data table (using Vue Good Table) for polling station results, with filters for region/district and sorting by vote count.
Pagination to handle large datasets (~34,000 polling stations).
Exportable CSV/JSON summaries for external analysis.


Implementation:
Build reusable Vue components for tables and cards, using slots for customization.
Manage vote data in a Pinia store, with computed properties for aggregations (e.g., regional totals).
Use Axios to fetch mock data from a JSON file or API endpoint.
Ensure responsiveness with Tailwind CSS or Vuetify grid systems.



4. Best Performers Visualization

Purpose: Highlight top candidates or parties by vote share or margin, with visual and exportable outputs.
Features:
Bar charts ranking top 5 candidates/parties nationally or by region/parish.
Pie charts showing vote distribution for a selected area (e.g., Kampala District).
Heatmap overlay on the map to indicate strongholds (e.g., NRM dominance in Western Region).
PDF report generator summarizing top performers with charts and tables.


Implementation:
Use Chart.js (via vue-chartjs) for bar and pie charts, with reactive datasets from Pinia.
Implement heatmap layers in Leaflet using leaflet.heat.
Integrate jsPDF with html2canvas for exporting dashboard views as PDFs.
Style charts with Uganda’s flag colors (black, yellow, red) for thematic consistency.



5. Security and Usability Enhancements

Purpose: Ensure military-grade reliability, security, and accessibility for field and office use.
Features:
Client-side encryption for sensitive data (e.g., vote counts in localStorage) using CryptoJS.
Audit log viewer for tracking user actions (e.g., data exports, filter changes).
Offline mode via Service Workers for caching maps and vote data (Vite PWA plugin).
WCAG 2.1 compliance (e.g., keyboard navigation, ARIA labels for map controls).
Dark mode and responsive design for mobile use by EC field officers.


Implementation:
Create custom Vue directives for input sanitization and access control (e.g., hide elements based on role).
Use LocalForage for offline storage of vote summaries and GeoJSON.
Implement audit logging in a Pinia store, with a dedicated component for admins.
Test accessibility with tools like Lighthouse and axe-core.



Technical Architecture
The application follows a modular Vue.js architecture for maintainability and scalability, emphasizing reactive data flows and performance optimization.

Frontend Framework: Vue 3 (Composition API) for reactive components; Vite for fast development and production builds.
State Management and Routing: Pinia for centralized vote data, user roles, and map states; Vue Router for navigation with dynamic routes (e.g., /region/:regionId/district/:districtId).
Libraries:
Mapping: vue3-leaflet for rendering; Turf.js for geospatial calculations; Leaflet.heat for heatmaps.
Visualization: vue-chartjs for charts; jsPDF and html2canvas for exports.
Data Handling: Axios for mock API calls; LocalForage for offline storage.
UI/Styling: Tailwind CSS for responsive, utility-first styling; Vuetify as an alternative for prebuilt components.
Security: CryptoJS for encryption; Vuelidate for form validation.


Testing: Vitest for unit tests (e.g., map rendering, data filters); Cypress videoconferencing for E2E tests (e.g., login flows, map interactions).
Deployment: Vercel or Netlify as a Progressive Web App (PWA), with Service Workers for offline access.

Data Sources and Handling
To simulate a realistic dataset:

Geospatial Data:
Download GeoJSON/shapefiles for Uganda’s regions, districts, sub-counties, and parishes from Humanitarian Data Exchange (HDX) or Simplemaps.
Convert shapefiles to GeoJSON using QGIS or Mapshaper if needed.
Sample structure:{
  "type": "FeatureCollection",
  "features": [
    {
      "properties": {
        "name": "Kampala",
        "level": "district",
        "votes": { "candidate1": 1000, "candidate2": 800 }
      },
      "geometry": {...}
    }
  ]
}




Vote Data:
Use historical election results (2016/2021) from openAFRICA or Uganda Elections Data Portal, available as CSVs.
Sample fields: polling_station_id, parish, subcounty, district, region, candidate_votes, total_votes, turnout.
Generate mock data for ~34,000 polling stations using Mockaroo if historical data is incomplete.


Processing:
Aggregate votes at higher levels (e.g., district totals) using Turf.js or JavaScript reduce functions.
Store in JSON files served via JSON Server or MirageJS for mock API endpoints (e.g., /api/votes/region/central).



Security Considerations
To meet military-grade standards:

Data Protection: Encrypt sensitive vote data in localStorage with CryptoJS (AES encryption); sanitize inputs to prevent XSS.
Access Control: Implement RBAC using Vue Router guards and Pinia; restrict raw vote data to admins.
Auditability: Log user actions (e.g., map filter changes, data exports) in a Pinia store, with tamper-proof timestamps.
Availability: Use Service Workers for offline caching; implement retry logic for failed API calls.
Error Handling: Graceful degradation for map loading failures; fallback to static summaries if geospatial data is unavailable.

Development Plan (8 Weeks)
This plan assumes familiarity with Vue.js components, props, and basic state management, with learning curves for geospatial tools and security practices.

Deliverables: Secure, accessible, tested application; live demo URL.
Learning Focus: Security best practices, testing frameworks, PWA deployment.

Challenges and Mitigations

Large Geospatial Data: Parish-level GeoJSON files (~10,000 features) can be large. Mitigate by lazy-loading sub-county/parish data on zoom, using simplified geometries (via Mapshaper), or caching with LocalForage.
Performance: Rendering thousands of map features may lag. Use Web Workers for vote aggregations and optimize with Vue’s v-memo directive.
Data Accuracy: Historical datasets may lack parish granularity. Supplement with mock data or interpolate based on sub-county totals.
Security: Client-side apps are vulnerable to tampering. Encrypt sensitive data and validate all inputs server-side in a production scenario.

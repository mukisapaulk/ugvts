# Voting Tracking System Design

## **Frontend**

### 1. **Map Interface**
- **Interactive Map**: Display regions and voting stations using libraries like Leaflet.js or Mapbox.
- **Region Highlighting**: Different regions with voting data shown through color-coded overlays.
- **Markers**: Represent voting stations on the map with tooltips or popups to show details (e.g., number of votes).

### 2. **Vote Data Display**
- **Dashboard**: Display total votes, votes by voter, and voting station details in real-time.
- **Filters**: Enable filtering by region, zone, or voting station.
- **Charts and Graphs**: Integrate libraries like Chart.js for graphical representation of vote counts.

### 3. **Search and Navigation**
- **Search Bar**: Search for voters, stations, or regions.
- **Region/Station Selector**: Dropdowns or lists for easy navigation.

## **Backend**

### 1. **Database**
- **Voters Table**: Store voter IDs, regions, and zones.
- **Votes Table**: Record votes with timestamps, voter IDs, regions, and stations.
- **Stations Table**: Store details of voting stations by zone and region.

### 2. **API**
- Develop REST or GraphQL endpoints for:
  - Retrieving votes by voter.
  - Fetching voting stations in a zone.
  - Aggregating vote counts by station or region.

### 3. **Authentication**
- Secure login for admins or observers to access and manage data.
- Role-based permissions to restrict access to sensitive operations.

## **Integration**

### 1. **Geospatial Data**
- Use GIS data to define regions and map station locations.
- Ensure the database can handle spatial queries (e.g., PostGIS for PostgreSQL).

### 2. **Real-Time Updates**
- Websockets or polling to update vote counts and map overlays in real-time.

## **Infrastructure**

### 1. **Server**
- Host your backend (e.g., Node.js, Python with Flask/Django, or Go) and database.
- Use cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure) for scalability.

### 2. **Frontend Hosting**
- Deploy the frontend on platforms like Netlify, Vercel, or static hosting on S3.

### 3. **Analytics and Logging**
- Track user activity and system performance.
- Implement logging for troubleshooting (e.g., Elastic Stack).

## **Optional Enhancements**

### 1. **User Notifications**
- Notify users of updates or alerts (e.g., voter milestones).

### 2. **Offline Capabilities**
- Allow data to be cached locally for areas with poor connectivity.

### 3. **Accessibility**
- Ensure compliance with accessibility standards for all users.
